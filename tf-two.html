00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,400
If you have seen the previous video on

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:06,400
AI for everyone series, the second video

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,601
or third video perhaps, you have seen

4
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:11,334
that you have already by far

5
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,267
you have learned that how to

6
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:17,534
import our tensorflow

7
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:20,801
library right?And it's quite easy. It's

8
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:23,268
very and we can also

9
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:24,468
print out the.

10
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:29,202
Version also I have already connected

11
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,935
here. So we if we just go through this we

12
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:34,402
can get the version of the tensorflow we

13
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,602
are going to use. And now the second

14
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:39,536
thing what we have seen is another

15
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,836
piece of code that is also very

16
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,403
important. That means this one

17
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,870
where we have this

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,836
one. OK, two constant

19
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,803
tensors. OK, now the question is

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,537
what these values are, how they look

21
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:59,137
like. First of all, how they look like.

22
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:00,604
Let us try to understand how they look

23
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:03,270
like this value. OK, so to do

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,071
that, what we have done a very simple

25
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:07,604
thing. Let us just

26
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,271
look at this value, look at this

27
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,338
table where. I have

28
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:18,071
this is our first row, right?

29
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:21,672
And this is our first column. This one is

30
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:24,272
our first column. OK and this is

31
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:26,938
so this is our first column and this is

32
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:30,005
our second column, right?This is our

33
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,206
second column and this is our first row.

34
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,872
And the first row first value is what

35
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,606
first row first value is. One and two.

36
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:41,139
That means one and two means this is one

37
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:43,873
and this is 2. Now look

38
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,706
at the value again. If you

39
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,406
look at the value again, you can see that

40
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:51,740
this is one and this is 2 and below one

41
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,373
there is 3 and below 2 there is 4. So let

42
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:57,207
us come back to this table. So below one

43
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:59,274
what below one is 3.

44
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:02,841
So we can write here 3. And

45
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:05,474
we can write here 4 right?

46
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:08,141
So this table goes on like this. We can

47
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,408
write here also five

48
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:13,875
and we can write here also six.

49
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:17,541
Now we can just say

50
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,075
that this value that means this one

51
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,809
is it. It belongs to first

52
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:26,742
row, first column right?And this belongs

53
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:29,276
to. First row but second column.

54
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:31,742
OK, this is our second

55
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,476
row, but this one is

56
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,276
2nd row but first column.

57
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:41,276
This is our second row and 2nd

58
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:44,076
column. This is our third row.

59
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:46,277
This one is 3rd row. Obviously this one

60
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:48,877
is 3rd row. So third row,

61
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:52,010
first column and 3rd row. Second

62
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,610
column. So more or

63
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,277
less this we can visualize by

64
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,677
drawing because this is a very simple

65
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,911
value, right?And we can also have

66
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,878
something like this 10123

67
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:05,144
kind

68
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,478
of things. OK, this is a simple array,

69
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,478
linear array OK and this is.

70
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,445
Of course not linear because this is a

71
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,212
table where we have the first column,

72
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,945
second column, third column, 4th column

73
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:23,212
like that and there are there could be

74
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:25,812
several rows. Now what about this one?

75
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,912
If you look at this diagram you

76
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:32,213
can see that there are several rows and

77
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,479
columns and it is a three-dimensional

78
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,613
object. So this is called

79
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:38,080
multidimensional array. OK.

80
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:40,780
And in Python the ND array you have you

81
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:43,280
may have heard if you know Python. So

82
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,747
multidimensional array is a very

83
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,947
difficult type of array and mainly

84
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:51,647
tensors are mainly

85
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,214
used for tackling such multidimensional

86
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,014
array and do more operations

87
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:59,814
like this. Like this one I can

88
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:02,414
tell you like this one this could be.

89
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:04,881
Very complex and you will see in my

90
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,615
future videos that how complex it could

91
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,782
be. OK, so if you

92
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:14,182
look at the look at

93
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:17,015
this Tensorflow operations, you can see

94
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,215
that if I just run this

95
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:22,882
one, you can see that this one is

96
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:26,182
like say 22. That means. Quite 2

97
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,016
two means there are two columns, 2 rows.

98
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:31,816
OK, it is also two rows and two columns.

99
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:34,816
OK, but it could be if I

100
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:37,816
just write like this one, if I add

101
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:40,617
three here and if we

102
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:41,083
add

103
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,350
five here and the same thing

104
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,017
if I done here.

105
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:53,617
Look what happens. And if we run this

106
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:56,284
code again, you can

107
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:59,184
see two and three, two and three, two

108
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:01,618
and three. That means that means

109
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:04,751
there are three columns and two

110
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,152
rows, right?If I come to the diagram

111
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:10,085
again, if I draw another

112
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:13,035
column. Here OK and if I

113
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:16,235
draw if I extend our row and we can

114
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:19,236
put some more values here also right

115
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:20,502
346

116
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:26,303
or anything else right?I hope you get

117
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:29,103
the point. Now tensorflow. Why

118
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:31,703
this data?Why this data and this

119
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:33,770
table is very?

120
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,903
Important because when

121
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,170
this data when this table

122
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,837
in belongs to and creates A

123
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:45,437
multidimensional array like this, this

124
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,271
could be very very complex one. OK, this

125
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,471
could be very very complex one. Now let

126
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,971
me just tell you some more

127
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:55,571
about more

128
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:58,538
about the. Types of machine

129
00:05:58,538 --> 00:05:59,771
learning because understanding these

130
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:02,005
categories helps you identify what kind

131
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:03,472
of problem you are trying to solve and

132
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,072
which machine learning algorithms or

133
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,039
approaches might be suitable. There are

134
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,105
many types of machine learning algorithms

135
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:13,239
and you can learn them. OK, you can learn

136
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,839
them and you can whenever you if you

137
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,239
practice more, you will

138
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,773
watch the data and you will

139
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,839
immediately. Understand what type of

140
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,640
machine learning algorithms can be used

141
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,440
for solving that problem. Now we broadly

142
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,973
categorize machine learning into three

143
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,340
main types. OK, number one is supervised

144
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,174
learning. OK, the idea is this is

145
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:37,907
like learning with a teacher. That means

146
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:39,240
you provide the algorithms with a data

147
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,974
set that contains labeled examples. This

148
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:44,107
means for each piece of input data you

149
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:46,041
also provide the correct output of label

150
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,641
that. Corresponds to it. OK so

151
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:51,774
I will give you examples of course and

152
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:54,908
examples like suppose e-mail spam or not

153
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:57,775
spam. OK what type of animal is in this

154
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,642
image that is cat, dog, bird etcetera.

155
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:02,575
Multi class classification right. So

156
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,642
basically what is in in this

157
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,475
place if you in instead of 123 if you

158
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:11,542
place image of dog and cat. OK,

159
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,976
dog and cat, dog and cat etc. And label

160
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,509
them as dog, dog to dog, cat to cat

161
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:19,243
etc. Then that is the supervised

162
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:22,243
learning. OK, that is

163
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,710
supervised learning and how it works. It

164
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,510
is simplified version. The algorithm sees

165
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,443
many examples. That means there are lot

166
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:30,977
of dogs and lot of cats

167
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:33,510
images. So just like a child

168
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:36,977
the tensors. The Tensorflow library and

169
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,111
the machine learning algorithms know how

170
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,844
to separate them and take them out

171
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,644
as separately. OK, and

172
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,311
in the case of spam emails the same thing

173
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:50,178
happens. Second is unsupervised learning.

174
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,111
That means there is. This is like

175
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,745
learning without a teacher. You provide

176
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,245
the algorithms with a data set that does

177
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:57,512
not have any labeled examples. And

178
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,178
example common task is clustering. That

179
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,279
means segmenting customers into different

180
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,112
groups based on their purchasing behavior

181
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,779
or dimensionality reduction. That means

182
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,312
reducing the number of features or

183
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:10,579
variables in a data set while while

184
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,546
returning as much important information

185
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:14,513
as possible. Example is compressing

186
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:16,779
images, simplifying complex data sets for

187
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,080
visualization or faster processing. OK.

188
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,847
And how it works?The algorithm analyzes

189
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:25,380
the data and finds inherent groupings or

190
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,847
ways to represent the data more simply

191
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,380
without being told what to look for. And

192
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,114
finally there is another type of learning

193
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:35,181
that is called reinforcement learning or

194
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,981
RL. The idea is it is like

195
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,114
learning through trial and error based on

196
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:42,348
rewards and penalties. An agent, the

197
00:08:42,348 --> 00:08:43,914
learning program interacts with an

198
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:45,681
environment. For each action the agent

199
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,515
takes, it receives a reward, that means

200
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:49,515
positive or negative. The agent's goal is

201
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,515
to learn a strategy, a policy that

202
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:54,248
maximizes the total cumulative

203
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:57,182
reward overtime. Now what

204
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:58,715
are the common tasks or algorithms?

205
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:00,882
Training agents to play games?That means

206
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:03,516
AlphaGo or game AI teaching robots to

207
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:05,782
perform tasks. Training, autonomous

208
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:08,149
vehicles, resource management, optimizing

209
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,983
energy consumption and there are lot of

210
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,716
more things it can do. So reinforcement

211
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:15,383
learning is fascinating field but it is

212
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:17,416
significantly different from supervised

213
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,417
and unsupervised learning and requires a

214
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:20,917
different set of techniques and

215
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,450
algorithms. While Tensorflow can be used

216
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,950
for reinforcement learning, there is a

217
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,984
library called TF Agents. It is

218
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,051
typically considered a separate area of

219
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,317
study. After grasping supervised learning

220
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:35,384
fundamentals, we will not be covering

221
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:36,851
reinforcement learning in this

222
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,784
introductory course because I again

223
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:41,485
repeat, this is a very advanced sector.

224
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:44,185
So we will concentrate mainly on

225
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,551
supervised learning and unsupervised

226
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:49,185
learning. OK, so that much today

227
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:50,852
and in the next,

228
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:53,519
in the next. Uh,

229
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:58,519
next video I will talk about Keras. That

230
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,919
means the API of the tensorflow and how

231
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,853
we can just use this one,

232
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,853
this diagrams

233
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:10,320
and use Keras to understand how it

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,253
works. OK, so till then, goodbye.

235
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:16,187
See you in the next video. Take care

236
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:17,187
and stay safe.`;
